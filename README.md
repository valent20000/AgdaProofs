# AgdaProofs
My agda proofs for my internship at Chalmers with Mr. Coquand

Here is the reading order of the files that i would advise :

- omega.agda
- Cat/Category/ZeroCategory
- complexes2.agda
- Numbers.agda

If you are interested in the internship in depth, you can also check the -naive ones after that, but they might not be commented.

Everything else is part of the 'bonus' part.
